Installation
============

From PyPi
---------

Install for development
-----------------------

If you are installing **BTB** in order to modify its code, the installation must be done
from its sources, in the editable mode, and also including some additional dependencies in
order to be able to run the tests and build the documentation. Instructions about this process
can be found in the `Contributing guide`_.
