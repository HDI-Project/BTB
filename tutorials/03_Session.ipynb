    "\n",
    "BTBSession provides a simplified user interface to be able to search the best solution for your tuning problem by combining tuners and selectors with as little steps required as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a BTBSession\n",
    "\n",
    "We will guide you through the necessary steps to get started using BTBSession\n",
    "to select and tune the best model to solve a Machine Learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, in this example we will be using ``BTBSession`` to perform solve the [Boston](\n",
    "http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston) regression problem by selecting between the\n",
    "`ExtraTreesRegressor` and the `RandomForestRegressor` models from [scikit-learn](\n",
    "https://scikit-learn.org/) while also searching for their best Hyperparameter configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare a scoring function\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in order to use the `BTBSession` class is to develop a scoring function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Python function that, given a model name and a hyperparameter configuration,\n",
    "evaluates the performance of the model on your data and returns a score."

    "- `tuner_class` (btb.tuning.tuner.BaseTuner): A tuner based on BTB ``BaseTuner`` class. This tuner will manage the new proposals. Defaults to ``btb.tuning.tuners.gaussian_process.GPTuner``\n",
    "- `selector_class` (btb.selection.selector.Selector): A selector based on BTB ``Selector`` class. This will determinate which one of the tunables is performing better, and which one to test next. Defaults to ``btb.selection.selectors.ucb1.UCB1``\n",
    "- `maximize` (bool): If ``True`` the scores are interpreted as bigger is better, if ``False`` then smaller is better, this should depend on the problem type (maximization or minimization). Defaults to ``True``.\n",
    "- `max_erors` (int): Amount of errors allowed for a tunable to not generate a score. Once this amount of errors is reached, the tunable will be removed from the list. Defaults to 1.\n",
